# Password-Generator

First I created a function to generate the password length with a prompt, with set perameters for acceptable length. After that I used confirms to gather user preferences about the use of lower, upper, numeric, and special characters, and stored the selections in strings attached to associated variables, which I then combined into a master variable called "password".

After that I created a random number generator that iterated a number of selections along the "password" variable equal to the password length that the user selected in step one. Finally I used existing code structure to write the result to the prompt box.

This was all very hard.
